        <h1>Description</h1>
        <p>This white chocolate chip cookie recipe is my favorite — my grandma used to make it for me. These cookies are really good with a tall glass of cold milk.</p>

        <h1>Ingredients</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>¾ cup unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>2 cups white sugar</li>
            <li>1 cup unsalted butter, softened</li>
            <li>2 large eggs</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1 ⅔ cups white chocolate chips</li>
        </ul>

        <h1>Steps</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Combine flour, cocoa, baking soda, and salt in a bowl.</li>
            <li>Beat sugar and butter with an electric mixer in a large bowl until smooth and creamy. Add eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Stir in vanilla. Gradually mix in dry ingredients, then fold in white chocolate chips. Drop by rounded teaspoonfuls onto ungreased baking sheets.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until set, 8 to 10 minutes. Remove from the oven, let cool on the baking sheets for 5 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
        </ol>
